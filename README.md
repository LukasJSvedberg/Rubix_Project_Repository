# Rubix_Project_Repository
This is a project I created, which solves Rubix cubes using Thistleweite's algorithm. <br>
The user can input any Rubix cube into an online GUI. After they do this, the computer will analyse the position and perform Thistleweite's algorithm to solve the cube. It will then output what rubix moves are required to solve the cube. There is also a Rubix cube which you can move using these keys: <br>
Left move = L<br>
Right Move = R<br>
Up Move = U<br>
Down Move = D<br>
Forward Move = F <br>
Back Move = B <br>
Holding shift does the move in the opposite direction, (Some move)' is the Rubix notation for this. <br>
I have completed the first 3 stages of the algorithm, which get the cube to the 3rd group (where all the edges of the Rubix cube are on the correct or opposite side.) However, I have had some problems with completing the final step of the algorithm which completely solves the cube, as the fourth stage does not solve all positions. Because of this, I have blanked out the code for this section.
